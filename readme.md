![chess logo](/images/logo_chess.png "chess logo")

### in this code want to test myself building a chess game using pygame, numpy, and a two server using socket or Flask api
# based on Docker-compose to make deploy the site, tools like  apache, Dns(bind9), php, mysql, firefox(to use dns(local) and acess the site inside the docker)
#
## to run you need start a server and join with 2 players in black and whiter side.
#

### the game runing is based on API and count win and lose rate of the user.
### acess my.little.chesslocal to create your account.




# have fun :)
